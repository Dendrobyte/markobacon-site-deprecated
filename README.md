# Mark's Portfolio Website

You can find me here: https://www.markobacon.com/

This is the old repository of post-graduation development! The new/current site's repository can be found [here](http://www.github.com/Dendrobyte/markside).

## Note on organization

Hello! Thanks for dropping by. Because I like things organized in particular ways, my portfolio site repository is currently sorted into a [frontend folder](/Markobacon_Frontend) and a [backend folder](/Markobacon_Backend). This makes deployment processes a bit easier (I just run the backend if I deploy it, and I only deploy built versions of the front-end to my site host). 

## What's this all about?

It's my portfolio site... and I chose to use React/Express for the frontend/backend! No particular reason really, just found it fun during a class of mine (and figured I'd stray from PHP). 

The front-end of the website is the look of everything. I build static files and push/upload those to my site host.

The back-end of the website is the operation of everything that is dynamic. At the moment, that's just the blog page pretty much. The framework is being built in Spring, on a currently privated repository.

Each folder has its own README with more instruction. The blog page is a project that will be wrapped up by the end of September 2021... and I'm not sure where we'll go after that! Hopefully make the front a little more... exciting, if you will :)
