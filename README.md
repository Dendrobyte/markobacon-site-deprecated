## Note on organization

Hello! Thanks for dropping by. Because I like things organized in particular ways, my portfolio site repository is currently sorted into a [frontend folder](/Markobacon_Frontend) and a [backend folder](/Markobacon_Backend). This makes deployment processes a bit easier (I just run the backend if I deploy it, and I only deploy built versions of the front-end to my site host). 

## What's this all about?

It's my portfolio site... and I chose to use React/Express for the frontend/backend! No particular reason really, just found it fun during a class of mine (and figured I'd stray from PHP). 

The front-end of the website is the look of everything. I build static files and push/upload those to my site host.

The back-end of the website is the operation of everything that is dynamic. At the moment, that's just the blog page pretty much. Login auth is currently using react 'n stuff, the rest uses Spring JS.

Each folder has its own README with more instruction. The blog page is a project that will be wrapped up by the end of September 2021... and I'm not sure where we'll go after that! Hopefully make the front a little more... exciting, if you will :)
